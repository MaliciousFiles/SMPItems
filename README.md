  All recipes are shown in the recipe book, but some recipes require multiple of an item.<br>

  Allows you to teleport to either a linked anchor or a linked teleporter (if held by a player), up to a limited range. Limited number of anchor connections, but unlimited other teleporters. Teleporters can be linked by crafting them together. Can be repaired in an anvil using ender pearls. Taking damage cancels teleport.
